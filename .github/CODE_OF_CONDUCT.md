# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming and respectful experience for everyone.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing when we make mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment of any kind
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
