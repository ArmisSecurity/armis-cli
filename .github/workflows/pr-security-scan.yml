      # PRs: Block on CRITICAL only
      # HIGH severity exclusion rationale:
      # - CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): Expected for CLI auth code
      #   that intentionally handles OAuth client secrets and JWT tokens. The CLI must
      #   read these from environment/flags and pass them to the auth service.
      # - These are false positives for security scanning tools in the context of
      #   authentication CLI implementations.
      # Push to main: Don't fail (code already merged, just visibility)
