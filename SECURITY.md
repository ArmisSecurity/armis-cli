## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability in this CLI,
please report it **privately by email**.

**Email:** security@armis.com

When reporting, please include:
- CLI version
- Operating system and runtime environment
- Clear steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Expected versus actual behavior
- Assessment of potential impact

Please **do not disclose security issues publicly** until a fix or
mitigation has been released.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The open-source CLI client in this repository
- CLI installation, configuration, and runtime behavior
- Packaging and distribution mechanisms

This policy does **not** apply to:

- Backend cloud services
- Proprietary APIs
- Hosted analysis engines or infrastructure
- Vulnerabilities affecting cloud-side logic or data

Security issues related to cloud services should be reported through the
appropriate cloud security disclosure channel.

## What to Report

Reports are considered in scope when they demonstrate a clear,
reproducible security impact affecting the CLI itself, including but not
limited to:

- Credential exposure or misuse
- Unauthorized access or privilege escalation
- Local or remote code execution
- Tampering with CLI behavior or outputs

Reports consisting solely of automated scanner output without a
demonstrable security impact may be considered out of scope.

## Coordinated Disclosure

After receiving a report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe
2. Investigate and assess the issue
3. Develop a fix or mitigation as appropriate
4. Coordinate disclosure once remediation is available

We request that reporters coordinate with us and refrain from public
disclosure until a fix or mitigation has been released.

## Responsible Research and Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research conducted in accordance with
this policy. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Avoid harm to users or data
- Avoid service disruption
- Respect privacy and applicable laws
