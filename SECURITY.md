## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this CLI,
please report it **privately** using one of the methods below.

### Preferred Method — GitHub Security Advisories

Submit a confidential report via GitHub Security Advisories:

https://github.com/ArmisSecurity/armis-cli/security/advisories/new

This channel supports encrypted communication and coordinated disclosure.

### Alternative Method — Secure Email

If you are unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, you may report issues
by email:

**security@armis.com**

Please include:
- CLI version
- Operating system and runtime environment
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Assessment of potential impact

---

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The open-source CLI client in this repository
- CLI installation, configuration, and runtime behavior
- Packaging and distribution mechanisms

This policy does **not** apply to:

- Backend cloud services
- Proprietary APIs
- Hosted analysis engines or infrastructure
- Vulnerabilities affecting cloud-side logic or data

Security issues related to cloud services should be reported through the
appropriate cloud security disclosure channel.

---

## What to Report

We consider reports to be in scope when they demonstrate a clear,
reproducible security impact affecting the CLI itself, such as:

- Credential exposure or misuse
- Unauthorized access or privilege escalation
- Remote or local code execution
- Tampering with CLI behavior or outputs

Reports consisting solely of automated scanner output without a
demonstrable security impact may be considered out of scope.

---

## Coordinated Disclosure

After receiving a report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe
2. Investigate and assess the issue
3. Develop a fix or mitigation as appropriate
4. Coordinate disclosure when remediation is available

We request that reporters **do not publicly disclose** vulnerabilities
until a fix or mitigation has been released.

---

## Responsible Research and Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research that:

- Avoids harm to users or data
- Avoids service disruption
- Respects privacy and applicable laws

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith
and in accordance with this policy.
