## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- SARIF standard `fixes` array for actionable fix suggestions with `ProposedFixes` and `PatchFiles` support
- Enhanced SARIF rule information with `fullDescription`, `helpUri`, and `help` fields
- Improved finding title generation (priority: CVE+package for SCA > OWASP category > secret type > description)

### Changed

- Separated spinner cleanup from result messages for cleaner progress output
- Only include `Help.Markdown` when it differs from `Help.Text` to avoid redundancy
- Added `stripMarkdown()` utility for SARIF `Help.Text` field per SARIF 2.1.0 spec
- Updated `anchore/sbom-action` from 0.21.1 to 0.22.1
- Updated `tj-actions/changed-files` from 46 to 47
- Updated `actions/checkout` from 4 to 6

### Fixed

- CWE URL validation (validate numeric before generating URL, fallback for invalid CWEs)
- SARIF line number validation (prevent invalid `DeletedRegion` with StartLine/EndLine = 0)
- Description truncation edge cases (period handling at position 80, trailing periods)

### Security

- Path traversal protection: skip paths when `util.SanitizePath` fails instead of falling back to original
- Command injection prevention: defense-in-depth image name validation in `exportImage`
